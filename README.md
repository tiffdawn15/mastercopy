# mastercopy 
This web application is a personal portfolio project for Tiffany Messer. 

## Mastercopy: 
Using the [Art Institute of Chicago's](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#quick-start) open source API I have created a Pinterest clone to browse works of art. It's a common practice for artists to create 'master copies' of another artist work. It can frequently be difficult to find high quality images of the work. I am hoping that this can become a conglomirate of many muesums open source art catelouge. 


## MVP Functionalnity
