# mastercopy 
This web application is a personal portfolio project for Tiffany Messer. 

## Mastercopy: 
Using the [Art Institute of Chicago's](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#quick-start) open source API I have created a Pinterest clone to browse works of art. It's a common practice for artists to create 'mastercopies' of another artist work. Since Google has upated their SEO it has become increasingly dificult to find high quality images from the actual artists. The results are filled with other artist's rendention of the artwork. I am hoping that this can become a conglomerate of many muesums' open source art catelouge.
